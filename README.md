# Diffindo â€¢ [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rails.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rails) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react)

Diffindo is a web app inspired by SplitWise. It allows users to generate, settle and keep track of split bills with other users.

The backend runs on Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, while the frontend relies on Facebook's React.js using a Redux architectural framework.

## Implementation

### A note on styling
All of the app's styling was done by drawing inspiration from dashboards, signup forms and other elements from other products and designers. All CSS was written from scratch, including the grid system which borrows from Bootstrap's terminology. Because of that, mobile responsiveness and media queries have not yet been implemented.

### Bills CRUD
Bills are the core of Diffindo, with each record storing the following:

| Column | Type | Constraint |
|------|:-----------:|:-------:|
| title | string | null: false |
| amount | float | null: false |
| category_id | integer | null: false |
| author_id | integer | null: false |
| payer_id | integer | null: false |
| date | date | null: false |
| doc_url | string | |
| split_type | string | null: false |
| created_at | datetime | null: false |
| updated_at | datetime | null: false |

When a user logs in, an API call is dispatched to retrieve all bills that the user has:
* created, joining the user and bills tables through `users.id` and `bills.author_id`;
* paid, joining the user and bills tables through `users.id` and `bills.payer_id`;
* split, joining the user and bills tables through a join table called `splits` (more on that later)

The information returned is in JSON form, being then stored in a store slice called `bills` for quick access. `bills` gets cleared when the session is destroyed (user logs out).

All bills relevant to the user are displayed as a list, being rendered by the `Bills` component. Each list item gets the corresponding `bill.id`, so it will know which bill to render when in edit mode:
![Bills#index](screenshots/bills-index.png)


The bills are grouped by their month, forming an array of bill objects. Iterating through this array, all bills are then rendered as `<li>`:

```javascript
<ul className="bills-list">
  {this.props.bills[monthIndex].map( bill => (
    <li key={`bill-${bill.id}`} className="bill-item row clearfix">
    {BillInformation}
    <i className="fa fa-pencil-square-o"
      aria-hidden="true" onClick={this.openModal(bill.id)}/>
    </li>
  )}
</ul>
```


When the **Add Bill** button is pressed, the `BillModal` component takes over, displaying the bill creation interface. Here is where all the magic happens:

![Bills#create](screenshots/bills-create.png)

Clicking on the blue icon next to each bill opens the same `BillModal` in edit mode. The difference here is that a `GET` request is sent to the server in order to fetch the corresponding bill.

### Splitting
While splitting may look easy on screen, there's a lot going on in the background:
![Splits#add](screenshots/adding-splits.gif)

Whenever a bill is created, a `POST` API call gets dispatched with all relevant data, according to the schema above. Added to that data is information regarding how the bill is being split and with whom. Such data is sent as an array of objects with keys `user_id` and `amount`. When these parameters hit Rails, new `splits` records are automatically created by the `Bill` modal. Should an error occur while the transaction is happening, such as the user forgetting to add the amount of the bill, a rollback happens and the `splits` records are never created.

### Friends (WIP)
From a database perspective, friends are nothing more than records association. In this case, two tables are involved: `users` and `friendships`. The latter's schema is pretty simple:

| Column | Type | Constraint |
|------|:-----------:|:-------:|
| user_id | integer | null: false, unique_on_user_id_and_friend_id |
| friend_id | integer | null: false, unique_on_user_id_and_friend_id |
| created_at | datetime | null: false |
| updated_at | datetime | null: false |

On the model side, Rails association takes care of joining both tables:
```ruby
# /app/models/user.rb

has_many :friendships, inverse_of: :user, dependent: :destroy

has_many :friends,
  through: :friendships,
  source: :friend


# /app/models/friednship.rb

belongs_to :user, inverse_of: :friendships

belongs_to :friend,
  primary_key: :id,
  foreign_key: :friend_id,
  class_name: :User
```

So far, adding a friend checks for existing users in the database from the e-mail entered. If one is found, a two-way friendship is created (two records are created at the same, with `user_id` and `friend_id` inverted). Otherwise, a new blank user is created and assigned an `id`. Such `id` is then used to create the two0way `friendship`, while the user record is assigned a `activated: false` flag. That flag will be then switched to `true` when the invited user joins and sets their own password.
